This Django backend implements a game service with matchmaking and real-time gameplay using WebSocket connections. Here's how it works:

Key Components:

1. Queue Management:
- `QueueManager` class handles matchmaking
- Players join/leave queue through REST endpoints
- When 2 players are in queue, automatically creates match
- Uses database transactions to maintain queue integrity

2. Game Sessions:
- `GameSession` model tracks match status (Pending/Active/Finished)
- `Player` model associates users with game sessions
- Players must mark themselves ready before game starts
- Tracks scores and winner

3. WebSocket Implementation:
- Uses Django Channels for WebSocket handling
- `GameConsumer` manages real-time game communication
- JWT authentication middleware validates connections
- Room groups isolate communication per game session

Flow:

1. Matchmaking:
```python
# Player joins queue
POST /game/join/ 
# QueueManager assigns position
# When 2 players ready -> creates GameSession
```

2. Game Connection:
```python
# WebSocket connect with JWT token
ws://host/ws/game/{game_id}/?token=jwt
# JWTAuthMiddleware validates token
# GameConsumer creates room group
```

3. Game Communication:
```python
# GameConsumer handles:
- Player ready status
- Game state updates
- Player movements
- Score updates
```

Key Features:
- Transaction-based queue management
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- JWT authentication for WebSocket
- Room-based game isolation
- Player state synchronization

The architecture enables scalable multiplayer gaming with proper authentication and state management.
